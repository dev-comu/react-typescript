# React TypeScript AtomicDesign Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for frontend development with React in TypeScript.

It applies a component design pattern based on AtomicDesign, using Webpack for the bandler and styled-components for CSS.

## Setup

Webpack-dev-server will launch and https://localhost:3000 will open in browser.

```sh
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

## UI Component Explore

Storybook will launch and https://localhost:6006 will open in browser.

```sh
$ yarn storybook
$ yarn build-storybook # build command
```
