# React TypeScript AtomicDesign Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for front-end development with React in TypeScript.

It applies a component design pattern based on AtomicDesign, using Webpack for the bandler and styled-components for CSS.

## Setup

Webpack-dev-server will launch and https://localhost:3000 will open in browser.

```sh
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```
